          Toshinori Yagi (八や木ぎ俊とし典のり Yagi Toshinori?), also known as
          All Might (オールマイト Ōru Maito?), is the former No. 1 Pro Hero who
          bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace (平和の象徴 Heiwa no
          Shōchō?). He teaches Foundational Hero Studies at U.A. High School.
          All Might was the eighth holder of the One For All Quirk after
          receiving it from Nana Shimura. He has since passed the torch onto
          Izuku Midoriya, whom he is training to be his successor. After using
          up all the embers of One For All to defeat All For One, All Might
          retired and ended his era as the world's greatest hero.
